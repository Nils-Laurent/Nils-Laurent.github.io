	abstract = {In this paper, the issue of averaging data on a manifold is addressed. While the Fréchet mean resulting from Riemannian geometry appears ideal, it is unfortunately not always available and often computationally very expensive. To overcome this, R-barycenters have been proposed and successfully applied to Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds. However, Rbarycenters still suffer severe limitations as they rely on iterative algorithms and complicated operators. We propose simpler, yet efficient, barycenters that we call RL-barycenters. We show that, in the setting relevant to most applications, our framework yields astonishingly simple barycenters: arithmetic means projected onto the manifold. We apply this approach to the Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds. On simulated data, our approach is competitive with respect to existing averaging methods, while computationally cheaper.},

	abstract = {Plug-and-play (PnP) image reconstruction methods leverage pretrained deep neural network denoisers as image priors to solve general inverse problems, and can obtain a competitive performance without having to train a network on a specific problem. Despite their flexibility, PnP methods often require several iterations to converge and their performance can be highly sensitive to the choice of the initialization and of the hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a new multilevel PnP framework that accelerates the convergence by combining iterations at different scales, and improves the robustness to initialization and hyperparameters setting using a coarseto-fine strategy. In a series of experiments, including image inpainting and demosaicing, we show that the proposed multilevel PnP method outperforms other PnP methods in both speed and reconstruction performance.},

Once the interference component is identified, we explain how it enables us 
	to define a criterion to locally adapt the window length used in the definition of the spectrogram, for the sake of improving ridge detection in the presence of close modes.

Then, we describe an algorithm to classify these points in an unsupervised way, based on the analysis of the stability of their location with respect to additive noise. Finally, potential uses of the classification of zeros of the spectrogram for signal detection and denoising are investigated, and compared with other methods on both synthetic and real-world signals.},

More precisely, the noise creates spurious oscillations in the local {CR} estimate, and we first put the emphasis on the terms responsible for these oscillations. Then we propose a novel technique to filter them out, resulting in a much more accurate local {CR} estimator. We finally show how to use the latter to improve mode reconstruction and investigate in what way the new {CR} estimator is useful in the context of voice signals.},
